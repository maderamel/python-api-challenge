Module 6 Challenge

# Part 1: WeatherPy
This section was an exploration of weather data across 500 cities of varying distanves from the equator. 
Deliverables included:
- Creating Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude 
- Using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code
- Creating scatter plots to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, Latitude vs. Wind Speed
- Computing and plotting the linear regression for each relationship

# Part 2: VacationPy
The goal of this section was to use weather data to plan vacation destinations.
Deliverables included:
- Creating a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
- Narrowing down the city_data_df DataFrame to find locations with ideal weather conditions
- Use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of coordinates
- Adding the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map
